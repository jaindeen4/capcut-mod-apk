        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 2: Create a New Project</h2>
            <p>Tap on “New Project” and select the video clips or photos you want to edit. CapCut will import your selected media into the editing timeline, where you can begin working on your project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 3: Trimming and Cutting</h2>
            <p>CapCut makes trimming and cutting your clips very intuitive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trim:</strong> Drag the edges of each clip to shorten or extend them.</li>
                <li><strong>Cut:</strong> Use the “Split” tool to divide a video clip into sections. This is helpful when you want to remove unnecessary parts of the video or rearrange clips.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 4: Adding Transitions</h2>
            <p>Transitions make your video flow more smoothly from one scene to another:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tap the small white box between two clips in the timeline to add a transition.</li>
                <li>CapCut offers a wide variety of transitions, from simple fades to more dynamic effects like "Glitch" and "Zoom."</li>
                <li>Adjust the transition length by dragging the handles to make it longer or shorter.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 5: Applying Filters and Effects</h2>
            <p>Filters can help create the mood or aesthetic you’re looking for. Tap on a clip, go to "Filter," and choose from categories like Retro, Party, or Cinematic. Effects such as glitch, blur, and VHS can also enhance specific scenes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 6: Adding Text and Stickers</h2>
            <p>To add text, click on the “Text” option, then choose either "Add text" or "Text template." Customize your font, color, size, and position to fit your video. Stickers and emojis can also be used to add fun or informative elements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 7: Sound and Music</h2>
            <p>CapCut offers a variety of royalty-free music tracks to choose from, or you can import your own:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to “Audio” and pick from CapCut’s library or add your personal soundtrack. You can trim or sync the music to match your video’s timeline.</li>
                <li>Use sound effects or voiceovers to make your video more engaging. CapCut allows you to record directly in-app or upload external audio.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 8: Exporting Your Video</h2>
            <p>After you're satisfied with your edits, it's time to export your video:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tap on the export button at the top right corner.</li>
                <li>Choose the resolution and frame rate that suit your needs (higher resolutions like 1080p are great for YouTube, while lower ones like 720p may work better for social media sharing).</li>
                <li>Export your video, and you're ready to share your creation!</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="#" class="btn-export">Export Your Video Now</a>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h3>Final Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> While CapCut offers many effects and transitions, it’s best to keep things simple and not overwhelm your audience with too many edits.</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Don’t be afraid to play around with different effects, music, and transitions to find what works best for your video style.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> Once you get used to CapCut, learn keyboard shortcuts if you're using it on a desktop, which will speed up your editing process.</li>
